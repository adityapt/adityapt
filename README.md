# Hi, I’m Aditya Puttaparthi Tirumala 👋

**Principal Data Scientist | Causal Inference & Marketing Science | AI / LLM Systems**

I lead a team of 8 data scientists building models and systems that actually get used. Most of my work sits at the intersection of **causal inference**, **marketing mix modeling**, and **LLM-powered decision support systems**.

A recurring theme in my work:

> the hard part isn’t modeling — it’s turning model outputs into decisions people trust.

That’s where I focus.

## 🧠 What I Work On

* Marketing Mix Modeling and Scalable Incrementality Testing Systems with explicit causal assumptions
* Translating complex models into decision-ready insights
* Agentic LLM systems that sit *on top of* statistical models (not instead of them)
* Time series modeling where interpretability matters as much as accuracy

## 🤖 SAGE — AI Copilot for Marketing Mix Modeling

**[SAGE](https://github.com/adityapt/SAGE)** is an AI copilot designed to help users *interact with* MMMs using natural language.

Most MMM tools fail at insight synthesis. SAGE was built to close that gap — even if it means being opinionated about workflows.

**What it does well:**

* Natural language Q&A over MMM outputs
* Automatic generation of visualizations and diagnostics
* Budget optimization using constrained numerical solvers
* RAG-backed explanations grounded in model artifacts and documentation

## 🧠 LLM-Copilot (Research / Systems Playground)

**[llm-copilot](https://github.com/adityapt/llm-copilot)** is a more experimental project exploring how LLMs can orchestrate analytical workflows around MMMs.

It focuses on:

* Tool-calling and orchestration (LLMs as controllers, not predictors)
* Retrieval-augmented generation over model outputs and benchmarks
* Safe, scoped code execution for exploratory analysis
* Integration with existing data platforms (Databricks, Snowflake, BigQuery, etc.)

This project is intentionally modular — it’s where I test ideas before they harden into products.

## 🚀 DeepCausalMMM

I’m the creator and maintainer of **[DeepCausalMMM](https://github.com/adityapt/deepcausalmmm)**, an open-source Python package for MMM that combines deep learning with causal structure.

**Design philosophy:**

> Prefer interpretability and causal structure over black-box accuracy.

Key ideas:

* GRU-based temporal modeling for adstock and lag effects
* DAG based causal graphs to capture channel interactions
* Hill-type response curves for saturation and optimization
* Multi-region modeling with shared structure and local effects

📦 `pip install deepcausalmmm`
📖 Docs: [https://deepcausalmmm.readthedocs.io](https://deepcausalmmm.readthedocs.io)

A JOSS paper is currently under review.

## 📚 What I’m Exploring Lately

* Multi-agent LLM systems for analytical workflows
* Hybrid RAG (structured + unstructured retrieval)
* Causal discovery in high-dimensional time series
* Uncertainty quantification in decision-focused ML

## 💡 How I Think About This Work

> *Good models explain why something happened.
> Great systems help people decide what to do next.*

That’s the bar I try to hold myself to.
