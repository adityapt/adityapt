# Hi, I'm Aditya Puttaparthi Tirumala 👋

### Principal Data Scientist | Causal Inference & Marketing Science

My Team and I build advanced statistical models and machine learning systems that help organizations make data-driven decisions. My work focuses on **causal inference**, **marketing mix modeling**, and **deep learning** for time series analysis.
